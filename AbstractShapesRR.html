    <h1>Abstract Shapes Reading Response</h1>
    
    <p>Starting off, I really enjoy how the user first enters the page. 
        This zigzag of color that slowly fills the page gives a good 
        entrance to the colors utilized in the main web design. Using 
        abstract shapes and vibrant colors in web design can create visually 
        striking, dynamic, and engaging experiences. Abstract shapes, 
        such as irregular polygons, curves, or organic forms, break 
        away from traditional grids, adding a sense of creativity 
        and modernity. Vibrant colors—like bold hues or gradients—infuse 
        energy, evoking emotions and guiding users' focus. This 
        combination gives websites a unique, playful, or artistic 
        feel in my opinion, while also enhancing user interaction 
        and making the site memorable.</p>

    <p>In critiquing the video, one aspect I would change is the
        design of the navigation buttons. The abstract style of 
        the buttons feels too similar to the overall design, which 
        can confuse the viewer. Navigation should be intuitive and 
        effortless; if users have to struggle to figure it out, it 
        distracts from the content. I believe abstract shapes should 
        be used sparingly or primarily to highlight key information, 
        rather than simply for decoration.</p>
