    <h3>Pickles come in a variety of types and styles, each with unique <i>flavors</i> and <i>preparation</i> methods.</h3>
        
    <p>Here are some <b>popular</b> kinds:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><i>Dill Pickles:</i> These are cucumbers pickled in a vinegar solution with dill weed, garlic, and spices. 
            They can be whole, sliced, or spears.</li>
        <li><i>Sweet Pickles:</i> Made with a sweeter brine, these often include sugar, vinegar, and spices. 
            Bread and butter pickles are a common example.</li>
        <li><i>Gherkins:</i> Small, crunchy pickles usually made from baby cucumbers and often sweetened.</li> 
        <li><i>Kosher Dill Pickles:</i> A type of dill pickle that is made according to Jewish tradition, 
            typically with more garlic and spices.</li>
        <li><i>Half-Sour Pickles:</i> These are cucumbers that have been brined in a salty solution but are not fully fermented, 
            resulting in a crunchy texture and milder flavor.</li>
        <li><i>Fermented Pickles:</i> These are made through natural fermentation, often without vinegar, which creates a tangy 
            flavor and probiotic benefits.</li>
        <li><i>Pickled Vegetables:</i> Beyond cucumbers, many vegetables like carrots, radishes, and cauliflower can be 
            pickled using similar methods.</li>
        <li><i>Hot Pickles:</i> These can be any pickles that are made with spicy ingredients, like jalape√±os 
            or chili flakes.</li>
        <li><i>Fruit Pickles:</i> Some fruits, such as watermelon rinds or peaches, can also be pickled, often resulting 
            in a sweet and tangy treat.</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <h3>Each type of pickle has its own distinct taste and texture, making them a versatile
