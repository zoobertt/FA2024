      Lirix  
    </h3>

    <p>
        LIRIX’s website features a clean, minimalist design that effectively 
        reflects its modern, professional brand. The strong use of neutral 
        tones with bold accents creates visual appeal, while the intuitive 
        navigation and clear typography enhance user experience. However, 
        the design could benefit from more dynamic visual elements to avoid a 
        monotonous feel. Additionally, some areas could improve in contrast for 
        better accessibility, particularly for users with visual impairments. 
        Overall, it’s a polished design, though small adjustments in visual 
        variety and accessibility could make it even stronger.

        **Green “scroll” circle confused me a bit because they use the same 
        design for some of their buttons

    <p>
        The design of this website is visually striking, particularly in how 
        it invites interaction. The high-quality scans and images showcase 
        textures in the paper, adding a tactile element to the experience. 
        You can almost feel the surface of the materials as you explore the 
        site, which gives it a unique, immersive quality. However, one area 
        that could use some refinement is the "Legend and Mythology" section. 
        The scrolling effect in this part, where images shift back and forth, 
        creates an engaging sense of movement but can be distracting. The text 
        overlaid on these images becomes hard to read as it gets lost in the 
        motion, making the experience somewhat dizzying. A more subtle 
        scrolling effect or clearer separation between the moving visuals and 
        the text could improve readability without sacrificing the dynamic 
        interaction.

        This website is highly effective, not just because the colors, 
        typography, and graphics harmonize, but also due to the engaging 
        use of animation. The 3D designs are visually captivating and 
        transition smoothly, adding an extra layer of interest. While it 
        would be great to have the option to fully rotate them, watching 
        them spin is still visually stimulating. The graphic design 
        elements and 3D models work well both on their own and in 
        combination, creating a seamless and dynamic experience.

        Loreal  
    </h3>

    <p>
        When I first opened the link, I was surprised by the aesthetic, 
        as it didn’t immediately evoke the L’Oréal brand. While it clearly 
        presents an image of innovation and a futuristic direction for 
        the company, I wish the design had a bit more reference to their 
        current brand style. The products being marketed feel more like 
        alien weaponry than hair styling tools, which can be intimidating. 
        That said, the website layout is engaging, giving the impression 
        that the viewer is stepping into the future as they explore the 
        content.

        This website was a lot of fun to interact with. I explored the 
        content multiple times—about eight, in fact—and each time it felt 
        like a new, exciting interactive experience. The different styles 
        kept things fresh, yet the black crystal element remained 
        consistent, which I really appreciated. It seems like the website 
        is meant to be experimental, showcasing various forms of 
        interactive media that are each individually expressive.

    <p>
        This website was definitely my favorite. It shares similarities 
        with many of the other sites we've explored, featuring a variety 
        of animations and displays that highlight the functionality of 
        the AirPods. The design has a sleek, futuristic feel that 
        complements the content without overwhelming it. The visuals are 
        stunning yet keep the focus on the information, creating a 
        balanced and engaging experience.

        The Boat  
    </h3>

    <p>
        The website for The Boat (SBS) offers a captivating and interactive 
        storytelling experience, with stunning watercolor-style 
        illustrations and seamless navigation. The design effectively 
        draws users into the narrative, with each panel unfolding smoothly. 
        However, the pacing can feel slow at times, and the interactive 
        elements may not suit all readers. While the visuals are beautiful, 
        the site could improve accessibility, such as better text contrast 
        and more navigation options. Additionally, performance issues may 
        arise on older devices or slower internet connections. Overall, 
        it’s a unique and immersive experience, though a few adjustments 
        could enhance usability and flow.
